# More GitHub Actions for Azure: https://github.com/Azure/actions

#
# NOTE: GitHub secrets must be manually added in GitHub.
# PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: Personal access token for the GitHub account that will be used to authenticate to GitHub
# Must have workflow scope to allow adding and updating of GitHub workflow files and admin:org scope to allow a push operation
# Note: technically an SWA only needs workflow scope, but I don't want to create a separate token for the web app.
# This is created under GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (Classic)
# AZURE_CLIENT_ID: Application client ID
# AZURE_TENANT_ID: Tenant ID
# AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: Subscription ID
# AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID: Service principal ID associated with the application client ID
# These are created in the repo itself under Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions > New repository secret
#

# Manually add a GitHub repository variable 
# AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_RG: Resource group name for deployment 
# These are created in the repo itself under Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions > Variables > New repository variable 
# See configuration variables: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows

# Manually create an environment called "confirm-deployment"
# Add ourselves as a reviewer to the environment
# This allows us to manually approve the deployment after the bicep file is validated
# See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment
# These are created in the repo itself under Settings > Environments > New environment
